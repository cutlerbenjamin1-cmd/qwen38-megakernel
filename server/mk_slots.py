    its own KV cache and recurrent state) and decodes every admitted request together, one engine cycle for all of them
    (mk_slots_step: one batched launch; a lone slot runs the solo megakernel); each request thread (Server._generate) gets
    the tokens of its cycles through its SlotJob. Requests wait for a free slot in arrival order and take the one whose
    sequence shares the most with the prompt, less what that discards of the slot's last prompt (a conversation's next
    turn goes back to its own slot and prefills only its new tokens; an empty slot goes before another conversation's).
    While slots decode, a waiting prompt is fed in chunks, one per cycle in the same pass as their step
    (mk_slots_step_mixed, MK_PF_MIX rows, default 256; MK_PF_MIX=0: MK_PF_CHUNK tokens between the cycles, default 512,
    0: the whole prompt), so they keep decoding while a long prompt is read; while none decodes, MK_PF_SOLO tokens per call
    (default 0: the whole prompt). With MK_EXACT the chunks change no row (the engine feeds every chunk but a prompt's
    last as batched rows, each ending on the 32-token scan grid: up to 31 tokens off the budget), so a prompt that
    arrives while others decode gets the reply it gets alone. A closed job is dropped from the queue, its prefill abandoned at the next chunk, or its slot left out of the
    next cycle. Open-jet's SlotScheduler (--parallel / --agents), with jobs that can be closed at any point.

    With MK_EXACT (exact reuse; --agents sets it), a prompt never reuses the rows a slot decoded: those depend on how many
    drafts each cycle verified, which depends on the slots decoding beside it. A prompt that reaches into the slot's last
    reply first takes the slot back to a checkpoint inside its last prompt (slot_begin with that prompt's tokens), as
    Server.load_prompt restores a checkpoint with --exact-reuse.
